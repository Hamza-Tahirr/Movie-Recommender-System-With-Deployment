# Movie-Recommender-System-With-Deployment.
In This Project I am going to build a movie recommendation system project and then build a model and then deploy it on Heroku.

## What is a Recommendation System. 
Recommendation engines are a subclass of machine learning which generally deal with ranking or rating products / users. Loosely defined, a recommender system is a system which predicts ratings a user might give to a specific item.

## Who Uses Recommendation System.
Companies like Amazon, Netflix, Linkedin, and Pandora leverage recommender systems to help users discover new and relevant items (products, videos, jobs, music), creating a delightful user experience while driving incremental revenue.
